<h2>What Is Aloo Keema?</h2>
    <p>Aloo Keema (or Qeema) translates to Potato with Ground Meat. It is a succulent Pakistani & North Indian Minced Meat and Potato Curry made with ground meat (commonly beef) which is seasoned with the traditional South Asian spices. The minced meat is added to a base of tomatoes and onion along with potatoes that add soft, tender texture.</p>
<h3>keema aloo curry ingredients</h3>
    <ul>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</ul>
    <ul>1 extra-large onion, chopped</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons water (Optional)</ul>
    <ul>2 pounds lean ground beef</ul>
    <ul>4 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root</ul>
    <ul>1 serrano chile pepper, finely chopped</ul>
    <ul>2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon ground coriander</ul>
    <ul>1 ½ teaspoons salt</ul>
    <ul>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</ul>
    <ul>3 potatoes, peeled and diced</ul>
    <ul>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</ul>
    <ul>1 cup frozen green peas</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon garam masala</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until soft and beginning to brown, about 12 minutes. If browned bits of onion are stuck to the bottom of the pan, add water and stir to loosen.</ol>
    <ol>2. Stir ground beef, garlic, ginger, serrano chile, and cilantro into the pan; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in coriander, salt, cumin, cayenne pepper, and turmeric; cook and stir until flavors blend, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and tomatoes; cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>3. Stir in green peas and cook until sauce has slightly thickened and flavors have blended, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle garam masala over top, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.</ol>
